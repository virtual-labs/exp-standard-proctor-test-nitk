      "question": "The measurement of compaction can be performed in terms of ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Permeability",
        "b": "Compressibility",
        "c": "Specific gravity",
        "d": "Dry density"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Permeability is measured in terms of rate of water flow through the soil in a given period of time.",
        "b": "Compressibility is the measure of change in volume of solid or fluid in response to pressure change.",
        "c": "Specific gravity is generally measured in relation to water at its densest state.",
        "d": "Compaction is measured quantitatively in terms of dry unit weight of soil."

      "question": "The aim of compaction is",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreasing dry density ",
        "b": "Increasing porosity",
        "c": "Decreasing void ratio",
        "d": "Decreasing shear strength"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Compaction is not about decreasing the dry density of soil. Dry density is the value  of soil when the soil is completely dry.",
        "b": "From compaction, porosity of soil does not increase.",
        "c": "Compaction of soil is the process of increasing the unit weight of soil by reducing the air voids by forcing the soil to a dense state.",
        "d": "Compaction of soil does not result in decrease in shear strength."

      "question": "Which of the following is the correct statement?<br>Vibratory rollers are suitable for compacting _____________.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Organic soil",
        "b": "Clays",
        "c": "Sand and gravels",
        "d": "Clay silts"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Organic matter attaches to the soil and binds aggregate and reduces compaction.",
        "b": "Clays are not suitable for vibratory rollers. Since clay is cohesive soil, sheep foot rollers are most suitable.",
        "c": "Sand and gravels are suitable for compacting in a vibratory roller.",
        "d": "Clay silts are not suitable for vibratory rollers."

      "question": "As the Compaction increases, the porosity decreases.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "False",
        "b": "True"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Compaction is the process in which air voids are reduced by arranging the soil to denser state. This arrangement of soil to a denser state reduces the porosity. Hence the given statement is true.",
        "b": "As the porosity decreases due to increases in compaction, the given statement is true."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "Which of the following does not produce compaction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Vibration",
        "b": "Tamping",
        "c": "Rolling",
        "d": "Adding excess water"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Vibration is the process of removing air voids by machine. Due to the vibration produced, the air voids will be removed and soil gets compacted.",
        "b": "Tamping is the process of removing air voids by giving tamp using a tamping rod. Due to the impact of the rod the soil gets compacted.",
        "c": "The Roller is made to move on the surface of the soil, which removes the air voids present and compacts the soil uniformly.",
        "d": "When water is added to the soil sample, the air voids get filled with water and it starts swelling which leads to consolidation. Hence reduces the compaction."
